She decides to turn over a new leaf by learning what it actually means to be “good” or “bad,” and then trying to make up for her past behavior.

There&#8217;s love, but there&#8217;s also tension.&#8221; The liars — along with Mona, whose trustworthiness will be reevaluated in this run of episodes, King teases — are called home to testify at a hearing for Charlotte&#8217;s release from Radley, and it isn&#8217;t long before they find themselves doing a very familiar song and dance. &#8220;Along with the new mystery in 6B is the birth of what I call our &#8216;Uber Bad&#8217; in the show,&#8221; King explains. &#8220;Who is this &#8216;Uber Bad&#8217;?

VIDEOSPretty Little Liars&#8216; New Intro: See All 5 Girls in the Season 6B Title Sequence 		 Though the identity of &#8220;Uber Bad&#8221; is being kept under wraps, King says its speciality is &#8220;taking advantage of everybody&#8217;s weakness,&#8221; which will make Emily — who is &#8220;by far the most damaged and broken by what has happened while we were away for those five years&#8221; — a prime target. And while I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d all love to point a big judgmental finger at Sara Harvey and call it a day, King is quick to remind us that &#8220;everyone is a suspect&#8221; — including the girls&#8217; new love interests. &#8220;Given the girls&#8217; history with newcomers,&#8221; she hints, &#8220;it&#8217;s fair to say that they should be cautious.&#8221;  			PHOTOSPretty Little Liars: Emily &#8216;Comes Clean&#8217; and Hanna Turns to Lucas in 6B 		 (In case you&#8217;re not caught up with the liars&#8217; romantic escapades, Hanna has a new fiancé named Jordan, Aria is getting flirty with her co-worker Liam and &#8220;Spoby&#8221; is simply a thing of the past.) &#8220;We definitely get edgier in 6B,&#8221; King says. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say we get darker, because we got very dark with the dollhouse, but the stakes are higher. And we&#8217;re more grown up. That&#8217;s the best way to describe the season: We&#8217;re all grown up.&#8221; Fellow PLL junkies, what are your hopes and fears for Season 6B?

Stats don&#039;t lie people 			  				  			 			 Still, Geller was further pressed about the lack of diverse leads on CBS series. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not casting color blind, we are casting color conscious,&#8221; Geller said.&nbsp;&#8220;It&rsquo;s the right roles for diversity.&#8221; He touted upcoming shows Rush Hour and Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders&nbsp;for having&nbsp;&#8220;two of the most diverse casts.&#8221; Additionally, the network&#8217;s Nancy Drew series, which is heating up for a pilot order, is planned with&nbsp;a diverse actress in the title role. Geller also&nbsp;showed support of reality and expresses high expectations for the upcoming straight-to-series Hunted, based on an UK format. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a big fan of reality&#8230; and&nbsp;I think we found the first reality hit, it&rsquo;s called Hunted,&#8221; Geller said. &#8220;It was my first buy.&#8221; The series features teams of two regular people who&nbsp;go on the run, hunted by real-life law enforcement enforcers with the goal to avoid capture for 28 days in order to win $100,000. &#8220;This brings a procedural element into the reality space,&#8221; Geller said. Geller also was asked about the pending departure of longtime NCIS co-star Michael Weatherly. As of now, there are no plans to bring NCIS alumna Cote&nbsp;de Pablo, who played his on-screen love interest, to exit him out, he&nbsp;said.

He was 78 years old and recently finished filming his role as&nbsp;Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in the upcoming ABC miniseries&nbsp;Madoff with Richard Dreyfuss, scheduled to air&nbsp;February 3. Margulies was&nbsp;memorable character actor with a camera-ready visage combining&nbsp;soft-edged jowliness and intense eyes that could change from flintily serious to the-joke&#8217;s-on-you charm in a flicker. He &nbsp;first drew notice in Woody Allen&#8217;s 1976 The Front.&nbsp;But millions of filmgoers will recall Margulies for his character-defining line from Mayor Lenny Clotch (an obvious tribute to the real New York Mayor, Ed Koch) in&nbsp;Ghostbusters II:&nbsp;&#8220;Being miserable and treating people like dirt is every New Yorker&#8217;s God-given right.&#8221; Other film appearances include A Most Violent Year, The Girl On The Train and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. He was a regular on most of the police procedurals filmed in New York and many other television series.

Compared to it&rsquo;s Live + Same Day audience, LSB leaped up 88% in viewers in delayed viewing. A lot of that was probably spurned on by the 18 million viewers the YouTube video of &#8220;Run The World (Girls)&#8221; taking on Dewan-Tatum&rsquo;s &#8220;Pony&#8221; pulled in. In L+3 numbers, the Season 2 opener of the L.L. Cool J hosted show peaked in viewership at 6.4 million during that &#8220;Run The World (Girls)&#8221; song and dance. Overall, with a 3.5 rating among adults 18-49 in L+3, Lip Sync Battle&nbsp;saw a 150% rise in its demo rating from its L+SD result of January 7. Those L-SD numbers were a series high for LSB, which also topped cable in the demo that night. Debut-to-debut, the S2 start of LSB was up 40% in the demo from the L+SD results of the April 2 Season 1 premiere.

Driver is repped by Gersh.  Amazon Studios, under Ted Hope, is ramping up its film activities.

Sweeney, Harry Lennix, Steve Harris, Angela Bassett, John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. Teyonah Parris plays the lead role. Amazon made its first feature acquisition earlier this year with the Kevin Spacey- and Michael Shannon-starrer Elvis &amp; Nixon, directed by Liza Johnson. Bleecker Street is handling the theatrical release on that one. Amazon also acquired Whit Stillman&nbsp;period comedy&nbsp;Love &amp; Friendship&nbsp;starring Kate Beckinsale,&nbsp;Chlo&euml; Sevigny, Xavier Samuel, Stephen Fry and Emma Greenwell.

The exit is part of a long-time plan the duo had publicly discussed to do the show for 7 seasons.  Would The Good Wife continue without the Kings? CBS certainly thinks that is possible. &ldquo;The Kings did say they would not be returning after this year, but we have a deep bench on the show,&rdquo; CBS&#8217; Entertainment president Glenn Geller said at TCA, singling out executive producer Craig Turk, who has an overall deal with The Good Wife producer CBS TV Studios. The future of The Good Wife&nbsp;will not be decided before the network sees its pilots but it&nbsp;&ldquo;can certainly continue,&rdquo;&nbsp;Geller said. As for where the series would go creatively after Season 7, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t discussed what the series would look like, what next season would be,&#8221; Geller said. Why the Kings are leaving?&nbsp;&#8220;I think it&#8217;s combination of things,&#8221; Geller said.&nbsp;&#8220;They want to work on new things.&#8221; Michelle and Robert King created and executive produce CBS&#8217; upcoming summer series BrainDead and have a number of projects in development, including Vatican City at Amazon, which they also wrote. A number of series have been able to continue without their original creative voice though it is hard for a serialized, character-driven drama&nbsp;as proven by examples like The West Wing. Like The West Wing, The Good Wife has been critically acclaimed as is the last broadcast drama series to earn Emmy nominations for best drama series. The Kings have won a WGA, a Peabody and a Humanitas awards for the show.

We’re thrilled about bringing another well known, beloved DC character to television.&#8221;  			See More:Greg Berlanti on ‘DC’s Legends of Tomorrow’: ‘It’s a Dysfunctional Family’ 		 Jonah Hex is a bounty hunter who has a deep moral code despite his fearsome, scarred appearance. The character was created in the &#8217;70s by writer John Albano and artist Tony DeZuniga, and was previously portrayed in live-action by Josh Brolin in the eponymous 2010 feature film, which became a box office bomb after grossing only $10.5 million domestically on a budget of $47 million. Hex was also featured in an animated short film, &#8220;DC Showcase: Jonah Hex,&#8221; directed by Joaquim Dos Santos and written by Joe R. Lansdale, in which he was voiced by Thomas Jane. Casting for the role has yet to be announced, but he&#8217;ll make his debut in episode 11 of &#8220;Legends,&#8221; with the possibility of recurring. &#8220;DC&#8217;s Legends of Tomorrow,&#8221; starring Victor Garber, Brandon Routh, Wentworth Miller, Caity Lotz, Arthur Darvill, Ciara Renée, Franz Drameh, Dominic Purcell and Falk Hentschel, premieres Thursday, January 21 on The CW.
